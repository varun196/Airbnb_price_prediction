# Airbnb price prediction

Hotel and lodging industry crossed $570 billion valuation point in 2018. Several companies like Airbnb and Flipkey offer tourists the option to lodge in homestays. We aim to predictlog rental price of the Airbnb lodging properties based on relevant information like property details, amenities, location and more which will be useful to the host and the customer in the real world. While there is a lot of work already done in this area, there is still a scope of improvement in predicting the prices more precisely and accurately. <br> <br>Traditionally, regression has been widely used for such prediction tasks.  But with the global acceptance of ensemble and neural network algorithms, it will be interesting to determine whether the traditional regression still serves the purpose better than these algorithms or not. Keeping the traditional regression model as a baseline, the project performs the comparative analysis of different algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and implementation efforts required to reach the given accuracy.
